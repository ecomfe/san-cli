[Full Docs](https://ecomfe.github.io/san-cli/)

## 🎉 Features

-   Complete project scaffolding.
-   webpack-based with zero configuration.
-   Extensible command line and webpack packaging plugins.

San CLI takes into account the San ecosystem while trying to achieve universal configuration. At the beginning of the design phase, we aimed to be not limited to the San application scope, but to make a general and customizable front-end development tooling.

## 📦 Installation

> San CLI requires Node.js version 8.16.0 or above (8.16.0+ recommended).

```bash
# use npm
npm install -g san-cli
# or use yarn
yarn global add san-cli
```

> If you want to use San CLI only in the project, you can add it to the devDependencies of the project package.json and then use [npm-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

After installation, you can view the help information with the following command:

```bash
san -h
```
